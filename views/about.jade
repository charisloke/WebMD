    p Transcription Hub was created by Varun Singh, a beginning jazz player and college student who was troubled by the fact that there was no central place to share jazz transcriptions.
    p Do you have feedback of any kind about the site (feature request, bug report, etc)? Use the tab on the left.

By uploading a transcription, you agree that the transcription was created entirely by yourself, by ear, or that you hold the rights to publish the material.
